<p>Sanos has a simple text editor. It is a text-mode application that runs with any 
VT-100 compliant console or terminal, like xterm, telnet, PuTTY, and the Linux console. While 
most other text-mode editors (e.g. vi, emacs, and nano) have custom key bindings,
the Sanos text editor tries to follow the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least surprise</a> 
by using the same key bindings as most GUI-based text editors like
gedit and notepad. These key bindings should also be familiar to anyone who has used
a web browsers. You navigate around in the text using the normal cursor control keys
(up, down, left, right, home, end, pgup, pgdn) and text can be selected by holding 
down the shift key while navigating. The text editor has a clipboard and you can 
cut (Ctrl+X), copy (Ctrl+C), and paste (Ctrl+V) text. Other commands also use the 
standard key bindings for GUI applications, like Ctrl+O to open a file, Ctrl+S
to save the file, and Ctrl+Q to quit the editor.</p>

<p>The Sanos text editor is a very simple editor. There is only one source file
(<a href="http://www.jbox.dk/downloads/edit.c">edit.c</a>) and it does not rely
only any external components except the standard libraries. It is not as powerful
as programmer's editors like emacs and vi, which can be used as complete 
programming IDEs, but it can be used as a rudimentary editor for editing text files.
It doesn't need any install program. It just consists of a single executable binary,
and it doesn't require any configuration files to work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Using the text editor on Sanos</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The text editor is part of the standard <a href="sdk.htm">Sanos SDK</a> distribution and can
be found in <code>/bin/edit.exe</code>. The source is located in <code>/usr/src/utils/edit</code>
and there is a Makefile to build it.

</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Using the text editor on Linux</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The text editor can also be used on Linux. There is only one source file so you just download this
and compile the text editor using GCC. It does not depend on any special libraries, so it should compile on
most systems that have GCC installed. The -Os option is used to generate a small binary. On my Linux box
the editor binary is 23,493 bytes.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>wget http://www.jbox.dk/downloads/edit.c
gcc -o edit edit.c -Os
./edit edit.c
</pre></div>

<p>Use Ctrl-Q to exit the editor.</p>
